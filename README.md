Summary
-------

Pandorified makes it easy for your Ruby scripts to interact with chat bots hosted on Pandorabots.

Installation
------------

	gem install pandorified

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is by using the `Pandorified::Session` class:

	require 'pandorified'
	
	my_bot_session = Pandorified::Session.new(MY_BOTID)
	first_response = my_bot_session.talk('Hello World!')
	puts(first_response)

In the example above, replace `MY_BOTID` with the actual botid of the Pandorabots chat bot you want to talk to.
