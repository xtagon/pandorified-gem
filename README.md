Summary
-------

Pandorified is a simple Ruby wrapper for the Pandorabots API. Talk to chat bots in your Ruby scripts!

Installation
------------

	gem install pandorified

Or add Pandorified to your project's Gemfile:

	gem 'pandorified'

Getting Started
---------------

To interact with the Pandorabots, you need to know the BOTID of the bot you wish to talk to. If you have published your own bot, the BOTID will be listed on your Botmaster page.

Here is a basic example:

	require 'pandorified'
	
	CHOMSKY_BOTID = 'b0dafd24ee35a477'
	
	# Send a message to Chomsky and print the response
	puts Pandorified.talk!("Hello, Bot!", CHOMSKY_BOTID)

Full documentation is available [here](http://rubydoc.info/gems/pandorified/frames). If anything in the documentation is not clear, please [report it as a bug][1].
